"""The project's shared exit-status vocabulary.

The launcher forwards a driver's exit status; it does not choose it.  ``ok`` is
therefore true only for ``0``.  Codes that describe a lawful scientific outcome
(for example ``57``, a finding) are still ``ok: false`` -- they are not success,
and calling them success is exactly the defect this server exists to prevent.
