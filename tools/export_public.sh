#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build a public, publishable tree for this project.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The working repository tracks things that must not be published:
# an internal dispatch ledger with agent transcripts, a steward's control files, review
# records, scratch output, and machine-specific absolute paths. "Which files are public"
# must be one re-runnable command rather than a hand decision made once, because a hand
# decision is re-made wrong later.
#
# WHAT IT PRODUCES. A directory (default `dist/public`) containing only the allowlisted
# paths, with machine-specific absolute paths rewritten to their symbolic equivalents, and
# — with `--git` — a fresh single-commit git repository, so the published history does not
# carry the internal one.
#
# USAGE
#   tools/export_public.sh                 # build dist/public, leave it as plain files
#   tools/export_public.sh --git           # also initialise a fresh repo with one commit
#   tools/export_public.sh --dest /tmp/x   # build somewhere else
#
# EXIT STATUS: 0 = export built and verified clean; 1 = a leak was found (build is kept for
# inspection); 64 = usage; 65 = pre-flight refusal (not a git checkout, dirty tree, or the
# criteria index could not be extracted); 69 = python unavailable.
