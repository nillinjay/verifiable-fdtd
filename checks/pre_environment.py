"""Pin and launch-config gate, before acquiring the resource lock.

Two roles, two rules (plan.md v2.0, 2026-10-12).

UPSTREAM is FROZEN PROVENANCE. It must stay clean and must stay at the commit every
result registered before plan v2.0 resolves to. If it moves, that is a hard failure:
the history it anchors stops being checkable.

THE FORK is OUR WORKING SOLVER. It is allowed -- expected -- to move, so it is
*recorded* rather than *forbidden*. The reproducibility that demanding a clean pin
used to provide is provided instead by the run snapshot: launch.py copies the solver
source into runs/<id>/snapshot/ and writes the commit and dirty state into
effective.json. A dirty fork is therefore fine; an *unrecorded* one is not.

Reproducing a result registered before v2.0 is still possible and is what
PARITY_SOLVER_ROLE=upstream selects.
